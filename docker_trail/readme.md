abstract = "This paper introduces a novel approach for identifying the possible large language models (LLMs) involved in text generation. Instead of adding an additional classification layer to a base LM, we reframe the classification task as a next-token prediction task and directly fine-tune the base LM to perform it. We utilize the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model as the backbone for our experiments. We compared our approach to the more direct approach of utilizing hidden states for classification. Evaluation shows the exceptional performance of our method in the text classification task, highlighting its simplicity and efficiency. Furthermore, interpretability studies on the features extracted by our model reveal its ability to differentiate distinctive writing styles among various LLMs even in the absence of an explicit classifier. We also collected a dataset named OpenLLMText, containing approximately 340k text samples from human and LLMs, including GPT3.5, PaLM, LLaMA, and GPT2.",

## Overview :

We have Replicated the original paper "Token Prediction as Implicit Classification to Identify LLM-Generated Text" for the CS678 Final project, class of Spring 2024

## Checkpoint 2, Reproduce :

Clone the project repository from the following link: **TOBDO**
Then, upload it to Google Drive. We used Google Colab to run this project, so you can access the code there.

## Requirement :

1. Run `!pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

2. To set the PYTHONPATH environment variable in Google Colab:
   import os

## Set PYTHONPATH to include the project directory

project_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/T5-Sentinel-public"
os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] += f":{project_path}"

## Optional: Print PYTHONPATH to verify the change

print("PYTHONPATH:", os.environ['PYTHONPATH'])

## Training :

ds already been genrated and downloaded to the approp folders,these are the paths:

1.
2. 1. `To Train the t5_sentienl model` - !python3 detector/t5*sentinel/\_main*.py

**NOTE** : When executing the training command, authentication through Wandb is required. Choose option 2 to indicate that you have an account, and then input the following API value - b0a6fecc14383f64f17b5bbd81acc18b7d864c55 to initiate model training.
You can find the Python notebook for reference at the following link: project.ipynb (https://github.com/vashihatej/NLP_Project/blob/main/project.ipynb)

## Observations :
